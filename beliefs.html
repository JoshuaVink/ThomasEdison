          <p class="mb-3">Bill Gates was a very competitive person. So much so, that he was often called out for unfair business practices. He was sued multiple times and didn’t always end up on the winning side. Even when he lost a lawsuit, he never apologized or admitted to doing anything wrong. Instead, he used continued innovation as an excuse for unfair business practices. He had a reputation among other tech companies as a ruthless competitor. Although he did make many personal donations to different causes, and after his retirement, he started his own charitable foundation. Gates stated that religion is very important to him. He and his family go to a catholic church. He believes he owes it to the world to try and reduce the inequity because of the wealth and success he has had.
