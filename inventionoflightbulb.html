          </h2>
          <p class="mb-3">In the 1870’s many inventors had already begun to find ways to produce light with technology. In 1876, Thomas Edison traveled to the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia to see Moses Farmer’s arc light invention. Thomas Edison believed he could improve upon it. His plan was to invent an incandescent light bulb, which would be softer and have less glare than the arc light. Another one of Edison’s goals was to make the lightbulb be able to be used for more than a few minutes at a time. He had an issue with the filament burning out after a couple of minutes. Edison experimented with different materials for the filament to try and accomplish this. He eventually came upon carbonized cotton sewing thread which allowed the light bulb to be used for 15 hours. The lightbulb allowed people to read the Bible at any time. It was a direct improvement to the candle which didn’t give off as much light, eventually burned out, and was a fire hazard. The lightbulb allowed you to stay up all night if you so desired, no longer having to stop reading when you ran out of daylight. Now that they had a working light bulb that could be used for more than a couple minutes, Edison and his assistants worked to perfect and mass produce it. It was a large project that took many years to complete.
