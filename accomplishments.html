              <p class="indent">Bill Gates has led a very successful life. His first main accomplishment was the founding of Microsoft. After which he wrote BASIC software to run on the new Altair computers. After MITS was sold to a new owner, Microsoft sued them to retain the rights to their BASIC software for the Altair computer. Microsoft continued to write software for many different kinds of computers. In 1979 Microsoft’s headquarters were moved to Bellevue Washington near Seattle. Already by 1979, the company was pulling in $2.5 Million. When IBM was looking for someone to develop an operating software for their new computers, Bill Gates was the one to get the job. Instead of making the software himself, he bought software from someone who had already developed it, adapted it to IBM’s computers, and resold it to them without telling the original owner of the software about the deal. Microsoft also insisted on selling this new software (MDOS) as individual copies. This allowed them to also sell it to other companies and to the public. Microsoft went on to create softcard which allowed their BASIC software to run on Apple II computers. These accomplishments caused Microsoft to jump in growth between 1979 and 1981. Their employees went from 25 to 128. Revenue went from $2.5 Million to $16 Million. In 1981 Gates and Allen incorporated Microsoft. Gates was appointed president and chairmen of the board, and Allen was appointed executive vice president. Microsoft started expanding to Great Britain and Japan in 1983. A third of the world’s computers were estimated to run on Microsoft’s software. In 1981 Apple and Microsoft collaborated to create software for Macintosh computers. After this collaboration, Microsoft created its famous Windows operating system.</p>
