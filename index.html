          <p class="mb-3">Bill Gates was born on October 28, 1955, to an upper-middle-class family. He was initially enrolled in a public school but was transferred to Seattle's exclusive preparatory Lakeside School because his parents thought he was becoming isolated. While at Lakeside he had access to an early form of the computer called a teletype terminal. He was very interested in what the computer could do and spent his free time using it. He even wrote a tic-tac-toe game in BASIC that allowed you to play against the computer. Gates scored 1590 out of 1600 on his SAT and graduated in 1973. Bill Gates met Paul Allen while in high school at Lakeside. Allen was two years older than him, but the two boys developed a friendship over their common interest in computers. They used the school computers to work on different projects together, often having clashing opinions about the work. At one point their computer privileges were temporarily revoked for exploiting glitches to gain free computer time from the company that supplied them to the school. When their privileges were restored Gates and Allen developed a payroll program for the computer company and a scheduling program for the school. In 1970 at the age of 15, Bill Gates and Paul Allen started making a profit on their programs. They created “Traf-o-Data” and were paid $20,000. It was a software program that observed traffic patterns in the city of Seattle. Bill Gates wanted to start his own business, but his parents wanted him to go to college and be a lawyer. Paul Allen dropped out of Washington State University after two years, and Bill Gates later followed suit. After writing a successful program for MITS, they founded Microsoft.
