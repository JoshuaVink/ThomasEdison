                <p class="indent">Thomas Edison’s next project was to deduce the best way to get power to the lightbulbs. With the building of the Pearl Street Station power was brought to Manhattan, but two different ways were discovered: Direct Current and Alternating Current. Edison supported Direct Current (DC) and used it to power all his inventions, but he had opposition. His former employee Nikoli Tesla supported Alternating Current (AC) and was hired by George Westinghouse to build a system for it. Research showed that AC was more efficient, but Edison refused to be beat. He even went so far as to stray animals and a circus elephant with AC to try and prove that it wasn’t safe. Westinghouse was shocked and offered to meet with Thomas Edison to settle the dispute, but Edison remained obstinate and refused. The battle ended up being decided by the consumers, who favored Alternating Current over Direct Current by a difference of five to one. George Westinghouse also got the contract to use Niagara Falls for producing power which only further cemented his victory over Thomas Edison. Edison admitted later in life that refusing to give in to Alternating Current was one of his biggest mistakes in life.
